I was given the tast to create my very oen portfolio using advanced CSS. This is intended not only as homework, but as a way to showcase the work I have done and the skills that I've learned thoughtout this course.

By using skills such as media query; Flexbox, and box styling, I am able to style my portfolio to best present my work.
